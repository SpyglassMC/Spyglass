Type For the spreading syntax (...), if the type after the spread operator cannot be resolved as a struct type, only the attributes on the type will be copied over to the current struct. StructKey STRING | IDENTIFIER | [ Type ] . A struct defines the schema of a dictionary-like structure consisting of key-value pairs, like a JSON object or an NBT compound tag. If a key is duplicated, the type of the later one will override that of the former one. A question mark (?) can be added between the key and the colon (:) to indicate an optional field. Example 21. Data pack tag struct struct Tag { replace?: boolean, values: [string], } . The spread operator (three dots, ...) followed by a struct type can be used to reuse fields from another struct. Example 22. Spread syntax struct Player { ...Mob, // Reuse fields from the Mob struct here. abilities: Abilities, CustomName: (), // Overrides CustomName from the Mob struct to an empty union. } . Although type parameters are not directly allowed in struct definitions, you can inline a struct on the right hand side of a type alias definition. Example 23. Type parameter type Tag&lt;V&gt; = struct { replace?: boolean, values: [V], } type BlockTag = Tag&lt;#[id=block] string&gt; type EntityTypeTag = Tag&lt;#[id=entity_type] string&gt; type FunctionTag = Tag&lt;#[id=function] string&gt; type ItemTag = Tag&lt;#[id=item] string&gt; .

Static and dynamic indices struct Foo { id: string, cow_data: minecraft:entity[cow], (1) dynamic_entity_data: minecraft:entity[[id]], (2) command: minecraft:block[command_block][Command], (3) dynamic_memories: minecraft:entity[[id]][Brain][memories], (4) } . | 1 | Static index on a dispatcher. | . | 2 | Dynamic index on a dispatcher. | . | 3 | Static index on a dispatcher, followed by a static index on a struct. | . | 4 | Dynamic index on a dispatcher, followed by two static indices on two structs. | . The default value used for all cases (including the two mutable special keys, %none and %unknown) is the fallback case. Example 26. Special static key: %fallback The %fallback key can be used to access the fallback case of a dispatcher. It cannot be used on the left hand side of dispatch statements, as the fallback case is generated automatically and cannot be manually declared. type AnyEntity = minecraft:entity[%fallback] . Example 27. Special static key: %none The case corresponding to %none is used when the accessor of a dynamic index gets no value at runtime. struct RandomIntGenerator { type?: (\"uniform\" | \"binomial\" | \"constant\"), (1) ...minecraft:random_int_generator[[type]], (2) } dispatch minecraft:random_int_generator[uniform, %none] to struct { min?: int, max?: int } (3) . | 1 | Note that type is defined as optional here. | . | 2 | The value of type at runtime is used as a dynamic index here. | . | 3 | The case corresponding to %none is dispatched to the struct here, so the random int generator can still get validated as a uniform generator properly when no value for type is provided at runtime. | . Example 28. Special static key: %unknown The case corresponding to %unknown is used when an unknown key is used to access the dispatcher. dispatch minecraft:block[%unknown] to () . Example 29. Special accessor key: %key The %key accessor key can be used to access the key where the current runtime value is. struct DebugStick { DebugProperty: struct { [#[id=block] string]: mcdoc:block_state_name[[%key]], // Get the type of the block state names of the block stored in the key. }, } . This struct can be used to validate the following data: . { \"DebugProperty\": { \"minecraft:anvil\": \"facing\", \"minecraft:oak_fence\": \"east\" } } . Example 30. Special accessor key: %parent The %parent accessor key can be used to access the parent value of the current runtime value. struct Item { id: #[id=item] string, tag: struct ItemTag { BlockStateTag: mcdoc:block_item_states[[%parent.id]] }, } .

A type alias can be created to refer to another complicated type for better code readability and reusability. Example 31. Type aliases type Integer = (byte | short | int | long) type Float = (float | double) type Number = (Integer | Float) . Sometimes we may want to create different type definitions that have roughly the same structure and only differ in some small aspects. Instead of duplicating codes, we can create a \"template\" type alias with type parameters. The right-hand side of the type alias statement can then reference those type parameters, which will get replaced by actual types when the type alias is instantiated elsewhere. Example 32. Type aliases with type parameters type NumericRange&lt;T&gt; = ( (1) T | (2) [T, T] | (2) struct { min: T, max: T } (2) ) type FloatRange = NumericRange&lt;float&gt; (3) type IntegerRange = NumericRange&lt;int&gt; (3) type NaturalRange = NumericRange&lt;int @ 0..&gt; (3) . | 1 | The type parameter T is declared in the angle brackets. | . | 2 | The type parameter T can now be referenced on the right-hand side. | . | 3 | When the NumericRange type alias is referenced elsewhere, an actual type must be suplied for the type parameter. | . Binding type parameters . All path references are resolved by the rules described in Path, and type parameter references are no exceptions. When a type parameter is declared in a type alias statement, it is temporarily bound to the current module until the end of the statement. Therefore, just like other type definitions, type parameters should be unique at the module scope. Example 33. Duplicated type parameter identifiers // File '/example.mcdoc' struct T {} type List&lt;T&gt; = [T] (1) // ^ // WARNING: Duplicated declaration for \"::example::T\" . | 1 | The declaration for T is warned and ignored, and the reference of T on the right-hand side actually refers to the struct T defined above. | . type List&lt;T&gt; = [T] type Struct&lt;T&gt; = struct { value: T } (1) . | 1 | This is fine, as although T is also declared in the List type alias statement, the effect of that declaration only lives until the end of that statement. | .

Or a more Complex structure with conditions: . | (object) . | if: (object) . | category: (string | string[]) . | pattern: (string | string[]) . | excludePattern: (string | string[]) . | namespace: (string | string[]) . | excludeNamespace: (string | string[]) . | . | then: (Action) . | override: (Complex | Complex[]) . | . | . Example 1. Example Config { \"lint\": { \"undeclaredSymbol\": [ { \"if\": [ { \"category\": [\"block\", \"entity_type\", \"item\"], \"namespace\": \"minecraft\" }, { \"category\": [\"advancement\", \"bossbar\", \"objective\", \"team\"] }, ], \"then\": { \"report\": \"warning\" }, }, { \"then\": { \"declare\": \"block\" }, }, ] } } . 👍 Good tag @s add foo . 👎 Bad setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:foo . Severity . All diagnostics provided by this linter will be of warning severity by default. You can wrap the config value in a tuple like this to change the severity to one of error, warning, information, or hint: . Config { \"lint\": { \"undeclaredSymbol\": [\"error\", &lt;value&gt;] } } . To Disable . If you do not wish to utilize this rule, simply set it to null: . Config { \"lint\": { \"undeclaredSymbol\": null } } . ",
