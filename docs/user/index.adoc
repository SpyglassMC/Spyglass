Welcome to the documentation site for Spyglass, a project that aims at improving your editing experience with Minecraft: Java Edition data packs by providing handy features like auto-completion, real-time diagnostics, semantic coloring and such.

It is planned to support multiple text editors, but for now, the only officially supported release is our vscode extension.
