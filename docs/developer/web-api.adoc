== Introduction

The Spyglass Web API provides access to various information that is helpful for data pack/resource
pack toolings. It uses https://github.com/misode/mcmeta[misode/mcmeta] and
https://github.com/SpyglassMC/vanilla-mcdoc[SpyglassMC/vanilla-mcdoc] under the hood and provides a
few advantages over using the GitHub API directly:

* Accessible within mainland China.
* Cache invalidation is handled through standard HTTP headers like `ETag` and `If-None-Match`;
  no more git commit sha hackery needed on client side.
* Cleaner?

== General Usage

The Spyglass API root endpoint is `https://api.spyglassmc.com/`. Clients must identify themselves
using the `User-Agent` HTTP header; requests without the `User-Agent` header will be rejected.

=== Error Handling

All error responses (HTTP status code `4xx` and `5xx`) will include a JSON body with the following
structure:

* `message`: (`str`) A human readable message describing the error details.

=== Conditional Requests

All API endpoints include an https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag[`ETag`]
header in the response. Clients should cache the value of `ETag` along with the response
body if possible, which can be achieved using the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage[CacheStorage API]
on browsers. For future requests at the same endpoint, clients should include the value of `ETag` in
the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-None-Match[`If-None-Match`] request
header. A `304 Not Modified` response will be returned if the resource has not changed since
the last response.

=== Ratelimiting

Each API endpoint has a point cost depending on how expensive it is to serve the request. Each IP
address can consume up to 100 points per one hour window before receiving `429 Too Many Requests`
responses. Additionally, the response time will be degraded starting from 150 requests per 15 minute
window.

.Point Costs
|===
|Type |Points

|Conditional requests that end up with `304 Not Modified` responses |0
|Non-tarball requests |1
|Tarball requests |5
|===

Number of remaining points is provided through the `RateLimit-Remaining` response header. When
`429 Too Many Requests` responses are received, the client must wait at least `Retry-After` seconds
before trying again.
