## üåê Localization

[![Localization status](https://weblate.spyglassmc.com/widgets/spyglass/-/multi-auto.svg)](https://weblate.spyglassmc.com/engage/spyglass/?utm_source=widget)

Spyglass supports multiple languages. If you'd like to help us translate this project to your language, it would be really appreciated!

### Steps

1. Go to the [localization website](https://weblate.spyglassmc.com).
2. [Register](https://weblate.spyglassmc.com/accounts/register) by linking your GitHub account (recommended), or using your email.
3. See two components of Spyglass [here](https://weblate.spyglassmc.com/projects/spyglass).
4. Start translating!

### Note

- If your language is not listed on the platform, simply [open an issue](https://github.com/SpyglassMC/Spyglass/issues/new).
- If you have suggestions for the source string (`en-us`), please [open an issue](https://github.com/SPGoding/datapack-language-server/issues/new), or discuss with other translators at the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/EbdseuS) if you'd like to.

## üí∞ Sponsor

[SPGoding](https://github.com/SPGoding) personally accept financial supports. The funds will be used for purchasing the server which holds the [localization website](https://weblate.spyglassmc.com), the rest money will be used for SPGoding's personal usage. _Intransparent, huh?_

If you're interested in sponsoring, you can go ahead to my [GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/SPGoding).
